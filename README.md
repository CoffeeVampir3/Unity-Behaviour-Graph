Alpha release party! Enjoy all you lovely peoples. The current branch has finalized, the current implementation should not mutate much from here. Experiments are living in the experimental branch if you're interested in what's on the horizon.

(Name Pending) Behaviour Graph! Lightning quick, zero allocations, 100/7 amazing graph for absolutely 0 dollerydos. Get a copy of your very own (Unnamed Behaviour Graph) today!

# Change Notes:

Added some QoL features namely colored nodes and the service/Condition nodes have reasonable sizing for their fields now.

# Dependencies

Note that this graph depends on both the (Sirenix) Odin Inspector and xNode.

# Quick Start:

Extract files into any directory in your project, that's it. A note that this will automatically add a Resources folder to "Assets" and create a single file named "bgsms" that stores serialization data neccesary for runtime execution.

# Documentation

Currently the only documentation is living inside the code, the example should make it very clear how to utilize the graph.
