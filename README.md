Alpha release party! Enjoy all you lovely peoples. The current branch is stable but still mutating, when documentation is finished I'll be finalizing the master branch and providing an experimental dev-branch for future changes.

(Name Pending) Behaviour Graph! Lightning quick, zero allocations, 100/7 amazing graph for absolutely 0 dollerydos. Get a copy of your very own (Unnamed Behaviour Graph) today!

# Change Notes:

Added some QoL features namely colored nodes and the service/Condition nodes have reasonable sizing for their fields now.

# Dependencies

Note that this graph depends on both the (Sirenix) Odin Inspector and xNode.

# Documentation

Currently the only documentation is living inside the code, the example should make it very clear how to utilize the graph.
